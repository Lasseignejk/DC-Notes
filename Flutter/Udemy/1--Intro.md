# Intro

## What is Flutter?

Flutter is a UI Framework that allows you to make cross-platform apps. By using Flutter, you can have a single codebase and still run apps for a variety of platforms, like Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and the web.

What Flutter does is it allows you to code in one language. That code is then transformed into machine code which then gets translated into specific code for Android or iOS.

Flutter is a framework for building user interfaces with Dart, which is a programming language.

While you can write the code for all platorms on the same machine, you can only test and run iOS/macOS apps on macOS machines, Windows apps on Windows machines, and Linux apps on Linux machines. Android and web apps can be built on all operating systems

## Project Creation & Setting Up a Code Editor for Flutter Dev

`flutter create first_app`

Make sure the emulator is running, then type `flutter run`.

## Understanding Material Design

Flutter apps by default use Material design, which is Google's flexible design system.

Material Design is a set of suggestions, rules, and guidelines that help you build beautiful user interfaces
